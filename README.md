## Welcome to Kevin Ralston's GitHub Pages

I am a Sociologist. I currently work for the University of Edinburgh.

Take a look at my [CV](https://github.com/kevralston/kevralston.github.io/blob/master/C.V.2017.v2.docx) if you like.

My research generally involves the study of inequalities and I have published papers examining inequalities in health, occupational and family outcomes. 

I specialise in teaching quantitative methods. I have also taught substantive topics such as social policy, social theory and social demography. 

My [PhD](https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/9815/1/Childbearing_and_First_Birth_in_Scotland_16may12_v.1.4.pdf) examined social group variation in the timing of first birth. 

I am a fan of using representative data and 'big' data in examining the social world. In my reserach I primarily work in the software Stata and R. I teach a lot using SPSS. I am exploring web-science techniques and intend to incorporate Python, Hadoop and SQL into my teaching and analysis.
