### [2017 CV](https://github.com/kevralston/kevralston.github.io/blob/master/C.V.2017.v2.docx) 

I am a fan of using representative data and 'big' data in examining the social world. At the moment I primarily work in the software Stata and R. I teach a lot using SPSS. I am exploring web-science techniques and will look to incorporate Python, Hadoop and SQL into my teaching and analysis.
